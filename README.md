# Studio Sleepy Giraffe

This repository houses the code and tools for my personal website. Having gone through many variations and much history I finally decided to start over fresh, primarily for security/privacy reasons. After years of hosting on my own RPi I've also shifted paradigm to hosting on CloudFlare pages instead to avoid having my personal website dependant on my ever changing home network.
