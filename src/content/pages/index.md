Summary: Cover page for my website.

I am Toben <a href="https://github.com/narcolapser">"Narcolapser"</a> Archer. I work as a software developer by day and the same by night as a hobby. At home, I work primarily in Python and React, making apps for Android and PC. This website, built with React, is set up mostly as a professional website. It is my website for sharing my work with friends, family, and potential employers. To see what projects I have been working on, click on the "Projects" tab. To read my mind (see what I was thinking as I worked on the various projects), go to the "Dev Log" page and select a project to read all of the development logs for that project. To read longer stories covering various topics, try the "Blog" tab
